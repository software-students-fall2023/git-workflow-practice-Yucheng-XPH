During this interview, the interviewee mentioned something about software engineering that really got my attention. He mentioned that unlike other computer science positions where all programmers have to do is to focus on developing and coding, being a software engineering is not only about coding, it is more about dealing and communicating with people, no matter they're your team members or customers.

Also, software engineering requires working as a team. The efficiency of the team is more important than how fast yourself can code. Working as a team can be really different comparing to working in solo. Since I like to work with others and dealing with people, I found the position of being a software enginnerer very attractive.
